You already know that [strength training](https://www.verywellfit.com/complete-beginners-guide-to-strength-training-1229585) is a crucial component to any workout routine if you want to get fit, get healthy, and lose weight.

Lifting weights allows you to build lean muscle tissue and burn more calories overall and all of this happens by challenging your body with [more resistance than it can handle](https://www.verywellfit.com/fitness-term-adaptation-1230984).

Yes, you can use your [body weight](https://www.verywellfit.com/body-weight-exercise-1229822), of course, but if you really want to make significant changes, you need [equipment](https://www.verywellfit.com/weight-training-equipment-4014316) and there's a lot of that out there.

Walk into any gym or sporting goods store and you'll see dumbbells, barbells, bands, machines... there are so many pieces of equipment, it can be overwhelming. It's no wonder so many people stick with cardio and avoid the weight room.

There's a way to solve that problem by simplifying your workouts and the equipment you use. In fact, you can get an excellent workout with barely any equipment at all if you have the right exercises.

Imagine you're in a [crowded gym](https://www.verywellfit.com/circuit-training-workout-1230851) with everyone fighting over a set of dumbbells or a weight bench. Or imagine you're at [home](https://www.verywellfit.com/best-ways-to-exercise-at-home-1231142), you're in a hurry, and the thought of having to lug all those weights around the room is just too much.

What if you had a go-to routine that only required one thing: one dumbbell? That's what this workout is all about. Effective, total body conditioning with just one dumbbell.

This workout is all about power and strength, taking the body through dynamic, sometimes ballistic movements that will not only challenge your strength, they'll get your heart rate up so that you burn even more calories.

It's almost like having a [cardio and strength](https://www.verywellfit.com/should-i-do-cardio-and-strength-workouts-together-1231582) workout in one, something that will save you time without compromising your results.

These moves aren't your traditional strength exercises but, instead, unique, [compound movements](https://www.verywellfit.com/compound-exercises-1230976) that involve your entire body. What makes this great is that the moves are functional. You move in all different planes of motion while working multiple muscles at the same time, which is how our bodies work in real life.

Best of all, you don't need much space and you only need one piece of equipment, a dumbbell.

One note: There is one caveatâ€”you may not be able to do _all_ the exercises with the same weight, so while you only use one weight at a time, it's a good idea to get three different dumbbells: Light (3-8 pounds for women, 5-10 pounds for men), medium (8-10 pounds for women, 10-20 pounds for men), and heavy (10-20 pounds for women, 20-30 pounds for men) so you have some choices.

You can also choose to perform these moves with a kettlebell or medicine ball.

Skip any moves that cause pain or discomfort and see your doctor if you have any medical conditions or illnesses.

* Warm up with about 5 or more minutes of cardio.

* Grab 1 to 3 dumbbells of different weights and find a space about that's about 4' x 4'.

* Do each exercise as directed, performing each with slow and controlled movements for the suggested time.

* Do each move one after the other with no rest in between.

* Complete one circuit for a 15-20 minute workout or do 1-3 circuits for a more intense routine.

* End the workout with a cooldown and a [stretch](https://www.verywellfit.com/relaxing-total-body-stretches-1231150).
