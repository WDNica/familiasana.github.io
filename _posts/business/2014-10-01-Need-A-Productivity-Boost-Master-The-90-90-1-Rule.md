Perhaps you've fallen behind on penning the next great American novel. Or maybe your sweet side gig has fallen victim to the "I'll just do it later" syndrome.

Regardless of what your unique passion (or even big work) project is, it can be all too easy to put it off-unless you have a master plan in place for when and how you'll finally get it done.

Enter the "90/90/1 rule", the brainchild of Robin Sharma, a leadership adviser and founder of global consultancy firm Sharma Leadership International.

The gist: For the next 90 days, devote the first 90 minutes of your day to your most important project-nothing else.

Fact: 45% of our everyday behaviors happen in the exact same spot, so identifying a great workspace can help integrate your passion project into your daily routine.

Why It's Worthy of Being Called a Power Hack This rule hits the time-management trifecta: It's simple, productive and feasible-since it'll cost you only an hour and a half of your time.

Ninety minutes probably won't feel like a huge time-suck, but it's still a substantial-enough commitment to actually make progress on a project.

Plus, if you're feeling really stretched for time, you can always hack the rule by testing out a "45/45/1" version.

How to Get Hacking Sharma suggests blocking off that 90 minutes each morning, but if that isn't doable, pick a time of day and a location-whether it's at your desk or a coffee shop during your lunch break-that will set you up for success.

Fact: 45% of our everyday behaviors happen in the exact same spot, according to researchers from Duke University-so identifying a great workspace can help integrate your passion project into your daily routine.

And when it's time to get to work, log out of your email, turn off your phone and check multitasking at the door for the next 90 minutes. That little text alert-bing!-may feel urgent, but so is that long-term goal you're working toward.
