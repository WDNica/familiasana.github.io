Let's start with the obvious, sex feels good. Aside from our biological need to have sex to pass on our genes, we have sex because it makes us feel good. On a neurological level, [having sex releases dopamine](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/love-actually-science-behind-lust-attraction-companionship/), a neurotransmitter that is [responsible for the feelings of pleasure](https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/explainer-what-dopamine) you get from [eating a piece of chocolate,](http://www.thisisinsider.com/heres-the-reason-why-you-crave-chocolate-2017-7) doing certain drugs, or well, having sex. It makes sense then that if sex feels good we want to do it as much as possible and feel good all the time, which is why having daily sex is ideal for me.

I have the pleasure (pun intended) of having sex every single day, and getting that dopamine release all the time and that alone is incredible. I can be having a miserable day but I always know that at the end of it, I get to go home, have sex, and feel amazing. Bad day instantly erased.

Not only does sex feel good on a physical and neurological level, it also makes me feel good about myself. The sex itself puts me in a good mood, but knowing that I'm in a happy, committed relationship that works well enough to support a great sex life makes me feel even better.

Before, when I had sex and showed up to work the next day, my coworkers would always ask why I looked so happy, but now I'm so happy all the time that they no longer ask because happy and confident is my base state.
