**Target-date funds.** Target-date funds are very misunderstood by investors. They are marketed as an investment that will automatically be adjusted to be less and less risky as the investor gets closer to retirement. The problem is that to make the funds less risky, they invest more of the fund's portfolio into bonds (eight to 12-year maturity). In an environment where the Fed intends to raise interest rates, these funds are becoming riskier the closer investors get to retirement.

While this economic environment may make it difficult for fixed-income investors to find safe income, remember that we also have very low inflation right now. Therefore, it's not necessary to get 5 percent to 6 percent interest on your fixed-income investments when inflation is less than 1 percent. If you're living on a fixed income, it is important to maintain the purchasing power of your savings.

However, getting a 3 percent return when inflation is 1 percent is the same as getting 6 percent when inflation is 4 percent, at least as it relates to purchasing power.
