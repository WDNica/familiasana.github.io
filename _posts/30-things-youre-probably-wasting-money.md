American households had credit card debt totaling around $16,425 on average in 2017, which was a 10% increase in indebtedness since 2013. At an average interest rate of 18.76%, the average household is paying around $1,292 each year in credit card interest.

If you owed the average and made minimum payments of $300 monthly, you'd take over 10 years to repay the debt and would pay more than $21,000 in interest along the way.

You don't want to spend decades repaying old debts and waste almost $1,300 every single year in the process.

Instead, create a debt repayment plan to repay what you owe as early and as aggressively as possible. Consider the debt snowball method and devote as much extra money as you can to the debt with the lowest balance. Once that's paid, roll all you were paying on that debt into the payment you make to the account with the next lowest balance -- and then keep going until all your debts are repaid.

While the debt snowball method may not make as much mathematical sense as repaying your highest-interest debt first, research has shown having wins along the way -- like repaying smaller debts -- keeps you motivated to continue your repayment efforts.
